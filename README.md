# Hello!
This repository contains some of my recent projects, where I explore machine learning and improve my data analysis skills.
All of the ML projects followed a CRISP-DM approach, being structured as such. If for some reason you are not able to preview the jupyter notebook on Github, please download it and open it using a code editor (for example VSCode).

## Insurance Prediction
The goal of this project is to be able to predict insurance charges, based on a set of variables. This is a regression problem where Linear regression, Ridge regression, Random Forest regressor algorithms were used.

## Sleep Health Prediction
In this project the purpose is to predict wether an individual has a sleep disorder, based on a set of variables. This classification problem explored algorithms such as K-nearest neighbors and Logistic regression.

## Purchase Behaviour Analysis
This data analysis project aims to find paterns and provide insights on the purchase behaviour of a group of clients. It started from a exploratory data analysis with python to foster data understanding and data preparation, so that the dataset could be analysed using PowerBI.
