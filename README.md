# Hello!
If you are here it means you already know me a little bit from my CV. If not, feel free to drop me a message on <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/carla--rebelo">LinkedIn</a>.
This repository contains some of my recent projects, where I explore machine learning and improve my data analysis skills.
All of the ML projects followed a CRISP-DM approach, being structured as such. If for some reason you are not able to preview the Jupyter Notebook on Github, please download it and open it using a code editor (for example VSCode).

## Insurance Prediction
The goal of this project is to be able to predict insurance charges, based on a set of variables. This is a regression problem where Linear regression, Ridge regression, and Random Forest regressor algorithms were used.
### ðŸ”§ Tools
Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn
    

## Sleep Health Prediction
[ongoing]
This project aims to predict whether an individual has a sleep disorder, based on a set of variables. This classification problem explored algorithms such as K-nearest neighbours and Logistic regression.
### ðŸ”§ Tools
Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn

## Purchase Behaviour Analysis
[ongoing]
This data analysis project aims to find patterns and provide insights into the purchase behaviour of a group of clients. It started from an exploratory data analysis with Python to foster data understanding and data preparation, so that the dataset could be analysed using PowerBI.
### ðŸ”§ Tools
Pandas, Seaborn, PowerBI
