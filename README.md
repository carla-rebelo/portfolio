# Hello!
If you are here it means you already know me a little bit from my CV. If not, hello again! I'm Carla, a data professional with a background in Information Systems who spends some of her free time doing data projects. Feel free to say hello back on <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/carla--rebelo">LinkedIn</a>!

This repository contains some of my recent projects, where I explore machine learning and improve my data analysis skills.
All of the ML projects followed a CRISP-DM approach, being structured as such. If for some reason you are not able to preview the Jupyter Notebook on Github, please download it and open it using a code editor (for example VSCode).

## Insurance Prediction
The goal of this project is to be able to predict insurance charges, based on a set of variables. This is a regression problem where Linear regression, Ridge regression, and Random Forest regressor algorithms were used.
### ðŸ”§ Tools
Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn
    

## Sleep Health Prediction
This project aims to predict whether an individual has a sleep disorder, based on a set of variables. This classification problem explored algorithms such as K-nearest neighbours and Logistic regression.
### ðŸ”§ Tools
Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn

## Purchase Behaviour Analysis
This data analysis project aims to find patterns and provide insights into the purchase behaviour of a group of clients. It started from an exploratory data analysis with Python to foster data understanding and data preparation, so that the dataset could be analysed using PowerBI. The outcome is a PowerBI dashboard.
### ðŸ”§ Tools
Pandas, Seaborn, PowerBI
